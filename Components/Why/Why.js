            You, like many other Nigerians have most likely hired an artisan
            (carpenter, plumber, electrician, etc.) who after claiming to be
            proficient in his area of expertise,{" "}
            <strong>ended up disappinting</strong> you. In addition to being
            unprofessional, some of these artisans are completely dishonest.{" "}
            <br /> <br /> We believe thereâ€™s a way to avoid hiring unskilled and
            untrained craftsmen.
            <strong> By leaving a review on your experience</strong> with an
            artisan who either satisfied you or disappointed you, you help
            others know who to patronize and who to avoid completely
            (individuals or companies).
